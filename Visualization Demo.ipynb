It activates PPARγ leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in β-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3β is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARγ by a potent ligand leads to β-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARγ activation in neuroprotection, PPARγ agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARγ activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARγ in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005].

When analyzing mRNA levels of these genes in human brain, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), were increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (P < .05). Furthermore, no clear differences in TCF7L2 and MYC mRNA were found in brains with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, suggesting that altered regulation of these Wnt-related genes could be specific to AD. Finally, mRNA levels of three neurogenesis markers were analyzed.

disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive dementia accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons; intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Recent studies have suggested that the trafficking process of membrane associated proteins is modulated by the FAD-linked presenilin (PS) proteins, and that amyloid beta-peptide deposition may be initiated intracellularly, through the secretory pathway. Current hypotheses concerning presenilin function are based upon its cellular localization and its putative interaction as macromolecular complexes with the cell-adhesion/signaling beta-catenin molecule and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) enzyme. Developmental studies have shown that PS proteins function as components in the Notch signal transduction cascade and that beta-catenin and GSK-3beta are transducers of the Wnt signaling pathway. Both pathways are thought to have an important role in brain development, and they have been connected through Dishevelled (Dvl) protein, a known transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway. In addition to a review of the current state of research on the subject, we present a cell signaling model in which a sustained loss of function of Wnt signaling components would trigger a series of misrecognition events, determining the onset and development of AD.\", \"citation\": {\"type\": \"PubMed\", \"name\": \"Brain research.
