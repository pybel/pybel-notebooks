    "This notebook is a self explanatory template. There should be a H1 Level header with the document name, the authors, the estimated run time, then a couple sentences explaining what the notebook is all about. After this introduction should follow a code block with all of the imports for the entire document, a code block describing the environment  under which the notebook was run, a list of single cells describing the versions of the dependencies. For PyBEL, this is the PyBEL and PyBEL tools version numbers, and finally, any additional setup for running the notebook."
